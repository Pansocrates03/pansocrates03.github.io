        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Dino Blocks' primary mission is to develop an engaging and captivating educational
            platform. Our aim is to make learning programming a fun and immersive experience
            for children. This platform is designed to stimulate their curiosity and interest
            in the world of coding from an early age.
            <br><br>
            It is our belief that by making learning fun, we can encourage children to dive
            deeper into the subject and cultivate a passion for programming. Our ultimate goal
            is to foster crucial skills in them such as logical thinking, problem-solving, and
            creativity. These are not only essential for coding but are also highly transferable
            skills that will benefit them in various aspects of their future lives.
            <br><br>  
            Additionally, we hope that the early introduction of these concepts can help create
            a strong foundation that will make their future learning path in programming and
            technology easier and more natural. In the long run, Dino Blocks aims to play a
            significant role in preparing the next generation of innovators and problem solvers
            who can use technology to shape a better future.
